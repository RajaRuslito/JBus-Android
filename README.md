# JBus Android Application

This JBus Android application was made as a final project for my object oriented programming class. In this application I made a simple bus ticketing application using java the main programming language. This application consists of two kinds of algorithm, the back-end and the front-end. On the back-end of this application, lay a foundation to build on for the front end. It has different function meant for different activities. But as of now, I mainly use only the basics provided. 

The feature of this application consists of: 
1. Registering an account 
2. Log in an account
3. Registering a company
4. Making a new bus, which include adding a schedule for the bus
5. Show existing bus
6. Make a booking based on available bus
7. Show relevant information on said bus
8. Showing a list of your booking history (whether it was accepted, cancelled or pending)
9. Accept and/or Cancel desired bus
10. Creating or Adding stations based on provided cities
11. Searching desired bus

This conclude all the features of the JBus Android Application, thus my final project for this class.
